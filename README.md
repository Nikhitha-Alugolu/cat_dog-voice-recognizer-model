Project Overview:

PetVoice is a machine learning-based voice recognition system that can distinguish between cat and dog vocalizations. The system uses audio recordings of cat and dog sounds to train a model, which can then identify the species of the animal making the sound.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather audio recordings of cat and dog vocalizations
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and annotate audio data for training
3. Model Development: Train a machine learning model using techniques like:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for audio analysis
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data processing
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision
5. Deployment: Deploy the model as a web or mobile application

Key Features:

1. Audio Input: Users can upload or record audio files of animal sounds
2. Species Identification: The system identifies the species of the animal making the sound
3. Confidence Level: The system provides a confidence level for the identification
4. Database Integration: The system can integrate with a database of animal sounds for continuous learning

Technologies Used:

1. Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch for building and training models
2. Audio Processing Libraries: OpenCV for audio analysis
3. Programming Languages: Python,
